```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
library(WorkInData)
data <- wid_open("../../../gender_growth_gap")
```

# Cluster setup

The microdata are stored on Yale's Grace HPC cluster.

Assuming you have a Yale identity, see the [YCRC guide](https://docs.ycrc.yale.edu/clusters-at-yale/) to get started on the cluster.

The package requires Arrow, which is available on the cluster in modules (e.g., `Arrow/16`).

# Using the data

Start by installing the package if needed:

```R
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("dissc-yale/WorkInData")
```

Then load the library and connect to the data:

```r
library(WorkInData)

data <- wid_open("/gpfs/gibbs/pi/dissc/work-in-data/gender_growth_gap")
```

Here, `data` is a regular [Arrow Dataset](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/reference/open_dataset.html),
so you can use `dplyr` to interact with it, but the `wid_subset` function can be used to filter more efficiently.

For instance, we might look at working status among those with a graduate degree in 2018 by age and sex:

```{r}
data_small <- data |>
  wid_subset(year == 2018, education == "Graduate") |>
  dplyr::select(age, sex, work) |>
  dplyr::collect()

data_small
```

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
with(data_small, table(
  c("Yonger", "Older")[(age > mean(age, na.rm = TRUE)) + 1L],
  c("Male", "Female")[sex + 1L],
  work
))
```
